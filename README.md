In recent years, investment firms of all sizes have heavily profited by developing and using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions ggive investment advisoryt firms a competitive advantage early on. Unbeknownst to even the best traders and advisors, tech people still need to specifically program these systems (often even above their highest performing paygrade), which limits their ability to adapt to new data.
