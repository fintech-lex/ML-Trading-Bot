# ML-Trading-Bot
Enhancement of existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

Demonstration 1: Tune the training algorithm by adjusting the size of the training dataset; to do so, data is sliced into different periods. 

Demonstration 2: Tune the trading algorithm by adjusting the SMA input features. Adjusted one of the windows for the algorithm with re-run notebook showing the updated parameters. 

Observation: By increasing/decreasing either SMA window (doubled for long window and increased short window from 4 to 25, the impact appears minimal, however in the beginning we show it more correlated and parralel.

Demonstration 3: Identify the set of parameters that best improved the trading algorithm returns. PNG photo saved shows visualized cumulative product of the actual returns vs. the strategy returns, for documented conclusion in README.md file.

Observation: Currently Testing.
